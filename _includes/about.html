            <p>Ottawa Civic Tech (#YOWCT) strengthens the community of people in Ottawa who build civic good. We bring together people in policy and technology to solve tough problems and make our communities better.</p>
            <p>As a civic tech group we provide a space for civic engagement between citizens, elected officials, and public servants. Our space allows motivated individuals with different skill sets like design, policy, activism, or software development to connect, innovate, create, and complete projects for civic good. By breaking down institutional silos we create possibilities and connections to build civic good that would otherwise be impossible.</p>
