# Ottawa Civic Tech Website

This is the website for [ottawacivictech.ca](https://www.ottawacivictech.ca). 

## What is Ottawa Civic Tech?

Ottawa Civic Tech is a community of citizens from diverse sectors and experiences who are interested in better understanding our complex social and civic challenges and building solutions at the intersection of technology, design, data, policy, entrepreneurship, advocacy, and citizen engagement.

Ottawa Civic Tech creates an inclusive environment and safe space for people of all backgrounds to connect, learn, share, collaborate, and participate in the democratic process in a modern and digital world. We aim to build a sustainable community by hosting regular meetups, twice a month.

Civic Tech hacknights are not unique to Ottawa. It is inspired by Code for America, and has sister groups throughout North America: from Toronto and across Canada, to Chicago, New York, or Boston. Join this global movement and come build a made-in-Ottawa community with us!
